# Are Fandango Movie Ratings Biased?

## Goal

The goal of this project is to investigate whether there were any changes to Fandango's rating system between 2015 and 2016. In 2015, Walt Hickey published an [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) where he explained how he discovered a bias in their rating system: even a rating of 4.1 would round up to 4.5 even though in the HTML code the rating was correct. Ultimately, it would skew all movie ratings to higher value and Fandango may have commercial interests in doing so.
